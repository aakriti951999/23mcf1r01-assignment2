    <h1>KHUSH MAHAL</h1>
    <img src="do2.jpg">
    <p>Khush Mahal, also known as Shitab Khan’s Palace, is a historical structure located within the
         Warangal Fort complex. Constructed during the Qutb Shahi dynasty, it showcases a fusion of 
         Persian and Indian architectural styles. Although partially in ruins, Khush Mahal still bears 
         witness to its former grandeur and provides visitors with a glimpse into the region’s diverse 
         historical influences.</p>
         <p>This is the Khush Mahal aka Sitab Khan Mahal. It served as the audience hall for the
             erstwhile governor of #Warangal after whom it is named. It is places like these outside
              #Hyderabad that most tourists to the state of #Telengana in #India miss out on.</p>
